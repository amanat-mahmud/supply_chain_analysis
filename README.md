## ❓ Problem Statement
The company faces challenges in optimizing inventory management, leading to overstocking or understocking issues. This inefficiency impacts storage costs, capital tied up in inventory, and the ability to meet customer demand promptly. Current analysis lacks focus on critical inventory metrics needed for informed stocking decisions.

## 🎯 Objective
Enhance supply chain efficiency by optimizing inventory management. This involves identifying key products to stock, determining optimal reorder points, and ensuring timely fulfillment of customer orders. The goal is to reduce storage costs, prevent stockouts, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## 🔎 Key Findings
- Inventory value: $1.59M
- Total sales: $33.05M
- Stock units: 18.97K
- "Small value, large number" product class accounts for the highest stocked items
- Consumer segment generates over half of total sales and profit
- "High value, small number" class contributes to more than half of the sales
- Standard shipping class dominates in sales and customer volume
- Profit and sales have been declining year-over-year
- Late deliveries consistently account for half of all shipments across years

## 💡 Recommendations

2. Enhance strategies for the consumer segment while exploring growth in other segments
3. Reevaluate discounting strategy across segments
4. Address declining profits and sales through various measures
5. Streamline order fulfillment processes
6. Prioritize on-time deliveries
7. Develop a balanced discount strategy
8. Focus on maintaining and enhancing the "high value, small number" class performance
